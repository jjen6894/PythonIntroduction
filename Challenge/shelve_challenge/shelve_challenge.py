# modify the program from the second dictionary challenge of lecture 56
# to use shelves instead of dictionaries
#
# Do this by creating two programs. cave_initialise.py should create the two
# shelves (locations and vocab) with the appropriate keys and values
#
# cave_game.py will then use the two shelves instead of dictionairies.
# Apart from opening and closing the shelves, cave_game.py will need only
# two changes to the actual code - remember keys must be strings
